Helpdesk Support System
Overview
This Helpdesk Support System is designed to provide efficient support for users through role-based dashboards for Admin, Agent, and User roles. Users can submit tickets, agents manage assigned tickets, and admins oversee the entire system.

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend is developed using React with Tailwind CSS for styling.

cd helpdesk-support-system/backend
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend root directory with these variables:

text
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=2000
Run the server:

Add your IP addresses (e.g., Render IP or 0.0.0.0/0 for testing) to the IP whitelist.

Create a database user with secure credentials.

Get your connection string (Mongo URI).

Render Deployment:

Push your backend code to a GitHub repository.

Create a new Web Service on Render linked to your repo.

Set the build command to npm install and start command to npm start.

Add environment variables (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.) on Renderâ€™s dashboard.

Deploy and monitor logs on Render.
